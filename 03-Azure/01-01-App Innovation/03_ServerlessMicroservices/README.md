# Build a serverless microservices architecture

## Introduction and context

In this MicroHack we will build a serverless microservices architecture.

Microservices are self-contained modules that handle independent services and can be developed, tested, deployed, scaled, and monitored independently.
A serverless architecture is a model within cloud computing where the service provider manages the infrastructure, so developers don't have to worry about provisioning servers and can focus on the code itself.
In summary, serverless microservices are independent modules deployed within a serverless infrastructure and run only when they are needed by the application which minimizes the costs.

## Learning Objectives

In this hack you will learn how to set up a whole microservice architecture in a small scenario in your own environment. Once we deployed the basic application, we will take a look at Azure Frontdoor and gain more insights, on how to monitor and manage your new setup.
