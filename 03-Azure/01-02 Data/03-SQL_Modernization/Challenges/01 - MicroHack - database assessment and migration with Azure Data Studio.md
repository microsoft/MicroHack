# Assess the application databases for Azure SQL Database suitability using the Database Migration Assistant

In this section we will use the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the applications database for suitability for migration to Azure Cloud.

|**Narrative**| **Screenshot**| **Notes**|
|:------------|:--------------|:---------|
|We need to determine the suitability of the database(s) for migration to Azure. This includes checking for compatibility and feature support with Azure Database.  You should already have a remote (Bastion) session open to your teams Win10 Management VM**,** if so run DMA from the Start menus or Desktop icon.|![A screen shot of a computer Description automatically generated](../Images/3967dd1b4dd31f5c19623f51ce94d486.png)|Database Migration Assistant (DMA) is a free download from Microsoft. It can be used to assess a number of database migration & upgrade scenarios not just SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.|
|You should see this screenshot to the right.  Select the **"+"** to create a new **assessment** project|![](../Images/e2b4706b838049af733fed665f6ada16.png)|
|Select/Enter the following details:  **Project name:**   **Workshop1**<br> **Assessment type:** **Database Engine**<br> **Source server type:** **SQL Server**<br> **Target server type:** **Azure SQL Database**<br>  Click **'Create'**|![](../Images/f562a7f4e609509f7032a192b15447d3.png)| Our first project assessment assumes we will be migrating to Azure SQL DB, so the options shown in the screenshot need to be selected.|
|Select the assessment checks (Report Type) to be made:<br> **Check database compatibility**<br>  **Check feature parity**<br>   Click **'Next'**|![](../Images/fec55ffa6e1278f1c5e336de2b67c7ff.png) | DMA can test for both database compatibility and feature parity compliance against the Azure target. As this is the initial evaluation, we are assessing a database(s) we will perform all of these tests.|
|Enter the source/legacy SQL details:<br>  **Server Name:**  **LEGACYSQL2012**<br>  **Authentication Type:**  **SQL Server Authentication**<br> **Username:**   **_Will be provided during hack_**<br> **Password:** **_Will be provided during hack_**<br> **Untick "Encrypt connection"**<br>  Click **'Connect'**<br>  *If you get an error logging in check that the Win10 keyboard language.|![A screenshot of a login box Description automatically generated](../Images/b2f7457ed4a46050afcd18073d4cd96c.png)|When performing this within your own subscription you will enter the host, authentication and connection types according to your company guidelines and practices. *Bear in mind that DMA needs to connect to a source SQL Server using an account that belongs to the* **sysadmin** *role.* As this document is produced within a workshop environment Active Directory, Certificates and encryption has not been setup.|
|Select **only** the 3 databases used by your 'Online Transaction Monitor' app. These will have a **TEAMxx** prefix where XX should be replaced by your team number.<br>  **TEAMxx_LocalMasterDataDb** <br> **TEAMxx_SharedMasterDb**<br> **TEAMxx_TenantDataDb**.<br>  Click **'Add'** to add them to the assessment. | ![](../Images/9488ec94afd6312aa62f3d0855683c83.png)|DMA will show all databases located on the Source host and display them so you can decide which ones to include in this assessment project. **Note**: you can assess multiple databases at the same time.
| You should now see the screen on the right with the relevant TEAMxx databases listed. Select '**Start Assessment'**|![](../Images/ace5ff77e60d0379b3856db4497d306b.png)|**Note**: DMA allows you to either 'Add' or 'Remove' additional data sources as needed at this point.  Also note that DMA provides some high-level metadata about the databases including their compatibility level the total size of each database.   [Using Data Migration Assistant to assess an application's data access layer](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-data-migration/using-data-migration-assistant-to-assess-an-application-s-data/ba-p/990430) |
| DMA will now show the results of the assessment using 2 separate reports:<br> **'SQL Server feature parity'** which is a server level report highlighting any server settings or components (e.g. MSDTC) that the source DBs are using that isn't supported on the target â€“ in this case Azure SQL Database.   In our assessment there are 'Unsupported" or "Partially Supported" features reported (**CLR**, **cross database queries, several trace flags**).<br><br>    **'Compatibility Issues'** which is a database level report detailing individual objects that have compatibility issues.  Select **TEAMxx_TenantDataDb** Note the 'Migration blockers' and 'Breaking Changes' including CLR which the database uses. CLR is not supported on Azure SQL DB but is supported by Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQLMI).|![](../Images/b9132f0c444aff5c9af7d4ebe165c543.png)![](../Images/70795f03ccd50ba39f7aafef5e5d2808.png)|**Note**: Toggle the parity and compatibility issues radio button (top left) to switch between the 2 reports. 'SQL Server feature parity' shows what features are not supported in the target data source. Under the 'Details' and 'Databases' sections on the right you will find remedial action that are required and the databases impacted. 'Compatibility Issues' shows, over the compatibility tabs, issues that need to be addressed to permit the database(s) to run, in the chosen compatibility level (e.g. 160, 150, 140, 130, 120, 110, 100). If you have multiple databases, as with the example screenshot, you need to highlight EACH database to see the compatibility issues.|
|| **Because we need to migrate CLR Stored Procs, we need to repeat the assessment with Azure SQL DB Managed Instance as the target to see if it's compatible**||
|Once you've reviewed the assessment click the back arrow to see a list of current DMA projects. You should see this screenshot to the right.  Select the **"+"** to create a new **assessment** project.|![](../Images/26f6da81414339b45fd763f27b58c84f.png)||

Also note that DMA has identified what compatibility level each source database is running under.|
| As before DMA will now show the results from the assessment as the separate 2 reports.  Note the '**SQL Server feature parity**' report will either be clean             The '**Compatibility Issues**' report should be clear for all 3 databases showing that they can be migrated to Azure SQLDB Managed Instance without changes.|![](../Images/6d2872ff60eb0f2926900c12e81c352b.png)  | Note: Toggle the parity and compatibility Issues radio button (top left) to see how DMA.  'SQL Server feature parity' shows what features are not supported in the target data source. Under 'Details' and 'Databases' you will find remedial action that are required and the databases impacted.  'Compatibility Issues' shows, over the compatibility tabs, issues that need to be addressed to permit the database(s) to run, in the chosen compatibility level (e.g. 160, 150,140, 130, 120, 110,100).  If you have multiple databases, as with the example screenshot, you need to highlight **EACH** database to see the compatibility issues. |

**We are now ready to migrate the application databases to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance**


# Migrate the application databases to Azure SQL Database managed instance using the Azure Data Studio (ADS) with migration extension and identify target Azure SQL SKU

In this section we will use the Azure Data Studio (ADS) to assess the applications database for suitability for migration to Azure Cloud.   

|**Narrative**| **Screenshot**| **Notes**|
|:------------|:--------------|:---------|
|We need to determine the suitability of the database(s) for migration to Azure. This includes checking for compatibility and feature support with Azure Database. You should already have an RDP (or Bastion) session open to your teams Win10 Management VM, if so run Azure Data Studio (ADS) from the Start menus or Desktop icon.|![](../Images/b75f90f39b5b822bc14d18ae2ffb8621.png)| Azure Data Studio (ADS) is a free download from Microsoft. It can be used to perform database administration as well as assess a number of database migration & upgrade scenarios not just SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.

|Select "extensions" icon on the bottom left ( or press : CTRL + Shift + X) and search for: "**Azure SQL migration**" in the extension market and click Install. (If extension is not compatible with the ADS version installed, upgrade ADS under Help \> Check for Updates).|![](../Images/a12dd92f76c6242ff3ff60b275ead646.png)| See also: [Azure SQL migration extension for Azure Data Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/extensions/azure-sql-migration-extension?view=sql-server-ver16) |
