# Exercise 3: Create a host pool for multi-session
[Previous Challenge](./02-Create-a-custom-golden-image.md) - **[Home](../Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge](./04-Implement-FSLogix-Profile-Solution.md)

## Introduction
In this challenge you will create Azure AD joined pooled desktops from a custom golden image created in Challenge 2. For higher sophistication we use the Azure Compute Gallery to provide the golden image and after deployment you will connect to the session host with multiple user and verify if the changes you included in the golden image are in place. Then you will also provide remote apps to your users.

## Challenge
Create multi-session Hostpool joined in Azure Active Directory
- West Europe Region
- Metadata located in West Europe
- Mark as Validation environment
- Host Pool type: Pooled
- Choose your Azure Compute Gallery image from the previous challenge
- Domain to join: Azure Active Directory (Enroll with Intune “No”)
- Register desktop app group to new workspace
- Assign users

Login to the session host
- Login as a user with local administrative privileges (Assign user access to Host Pools)
- Verify if VScode and Notepad++ is installed

Deploy Notepad++ and VSCode as Remote App

## Success Criteria
1.	Host Pools are created and Session Hosts are showing available
2.	Users are assigned to the appropriate application group of the host pool
3.	Able to show the Host Pool settings configured.
4.	VMs are joined to Azure AD
5.	Users can sign in to the VM.
6.	Notepad++ is installed on all VMs within the pooled Hostpool and can be accessed via RemoteApp
