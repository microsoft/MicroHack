## MicroHack introduction

### What is Azure Arc?

For customers who want to simplify complex and distributed environments across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud, [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-arc/) enables deployment of Azure services anywhere and extends Azure management to any infrastructure. Azure Arc helps you accelerate innovation across hybrid and multi-cloud environments and provides the following benefits to your organization:

![image](./img/AzureArc-01.png)

- Gain central visibility, operations, and compliance Standardize visibility, operationsand compliance across a wide range of resources and locations by extending the Azure control plane. Right from Azure, you can easily organize, govern, and secure Windows, Linux, SQL Servers and Kubernetes clusters across datacenters, edge, and multi-cloud.

- Build Cloud native apps anywhere, at scale Centrally code and deploy applications confidently to any Kubernetes distribution in any location. Accelerate development by using best in class applications services with standardized deployment, configuration, security, and observability.

- Run Azure services anywhere Flexibly use cloud innovation where you need it by deploying Azure services anywhere. Implement cloud practices and automation to deploy faster, consistently, and at scale with always-up-to-date Azure Arc enabled services.

## MicroHack context

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of Azure Arc with a focus on the best practices and the design principles and some interesting challenges for real world scenarios. Specifically, this builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure in your datacenter.

## Challenge 3 - Access Azure resources using Managed Identities from your on-premises servers

### Goal

Managing secrets, credentials or certificates to secure communication between different services is a main challenge for developers and administrators. Managed Identities is Azure's answer to all these challenges and eliminates the need to manage and securely store secrets, credentials or certificates on the virtual machine. In challenge 3 you will leverage Managed Identities via Azure Arc to securely access an Azure Key Vault secret from your Azure Arc enabled servers without the need of managing any credential.

### Actions

- Create an Azure Key Vault in your Azure resource group
- Create a secret in the Azure Key Vault and assign permissions to your Linux virtual machine
- Access the secret via bash script

### Success Criteria

- You successfully output the secret in the terminal on your Linux server without providing any credentials (except for your SSH login ðŸ˜Š).

- In this challenge, we will integrate your Azure Arc connected machines with Azure Defender for Cloud. After completing the previous challenges, you should now have an Azure subscription with one or more Azure Arc-enabled servers. You should also have an available Log Analytics workspace and have deployed the Log Analytics agent to your server(s).

### Actions

- Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud on your Azure Arc-enabled machines.

### Success criteria

## Challenge 6 - Activate ESU for Windows Server 2012 R2 via Arc - optional

### Goal

In this challenge, you will activate Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Windows Server 2012 R2 via Azure Arc. This will ensure that your server continues to receive critical security updates beyond the end of support date and allows you to stop paying for updates once the server gets decommissioned or upgraded.

### Actions

- Purchase and activate the ESU license for your Windows Server 2012 R2.
- Apply the ESU license to your server.

### Success criteria

- The ESU license is purchased and activated.
- The server has an attached ESU license and its ESU status shows as "Enabled"

## Challenge 7 - Azure Monitor for virtual machines

### Goal

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of **Azure Monitor** with a focus on the best practices and the design principles of how to monitor your overall Azure infrastructure (Iaas and PaaS) and applications accordingly. Specifically, this builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure like Virtual Machines, Application Gateway, Container Apps etc.

Note: This is a separate MicroHack which requires its own dedicated set of virtual machines.

### Actions

- Delete all 3 virtual machines from the Azure Arc-related challenges to free up resources in the subscription
- Follow the instructions in the [Azure Monitor for virtual machines MicroHack](../07_Azure_Monitor/README.md)

## Finish

Congratulations! You finished the MicroHack Azure Arc for Servers. We hope you had the chance to learn about the Hybrid capabilities of Azure.
