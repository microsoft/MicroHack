# **MicroHack Azure Arc for Servers**

[toc]

## MicroHack introduction

What is Azure Arc?

For customers who want to simplify complex and distributed environments across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud, [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-arc/) enables deployment of Azure services anywhere and extends Azure management to any infrastructure. Azure Arc helps you accelerate innovation across hybrid and multi-cloud environments and provides the following benefits to your organization:

- Gain central visibility, operations, and compliance Standardize visibility, operationsand compliance across a wide range of resources and locations by extending the Azure control plane. Right from Azure, you can easily organize, govern, and secure Windows, Linux, SQL Servers and Kubernetes clusters across datacenters, edge, and multi-cloud.

- Build Cloud native apps anywhere, at scale Centrally code and deploy applications confidently to any Kubernetes distribution in any location. Accelerate development by using best in class applications services with standardized deployment, configuration, security, and observability.

- Run Azure services anywhere Flexibly use cloud innovation where you need it by deploying Azure services anywhere. Implement cloud practices and automation to deploy faster, consistently, and at scale with always-up-to-date Azure Arc enabled services.

## MicroHack context

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of Azure Arc with a focus on the best practices and the design principles and some interesting challenges for real world scenarios. Specifically, this builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure in your datacenter.

## Challenge 3 - Access Azure resources using Managed Identities from your on-premises servers

## Goal

Managing secrets, credentials or certificates to secure communication between different services is a main challenge for developers and administrators. Managed Identities is Azure's answer to all these challenges and eliminates the need to manage and securely store secrets, credentials or certificates on the Virtual Machine. In challenge 4 you will leverage Managed Identities via Azure Arc to securely access an Azure Key Vault secret from your Azure Arc enabled servers without the need of managing any credential. 

## Actions

* Create an Azure Key Vault in your Azure resource group
* Create a secret in the Azure Key Vault and assign permissions to your Virtual Machine lin-app
* Access the secret via Bash script

## Success Criteria

* You successfully output the secret in the terminal on lin-app without providing any credentials (except for your SSH login ðŸ˜Š).

## Learning resources

* [Create a key vault using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal)
* [Set and retrieve a secret from Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal)
* [Use a Linux VM system-assigned managed identity to access Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/tutorial-linux-vm-access-nonaad)
