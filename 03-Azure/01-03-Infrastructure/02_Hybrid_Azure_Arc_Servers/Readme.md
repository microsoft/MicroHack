## MicroHack introduction

### What is Azure Arc?

For customers who want to simplify complex and distributed environments across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud, [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-arc/) enables deployment of Azure services anywhere and extends Azure management to any infrastructure. Azure Arc helps you accelerate innovation across hybrid and multi-cloud environments and provides the following benefits to your organization:

![image](./img/AzureArc-01.png)

- Gain central visibility, operations, and compliance Standardize visibility, operationsand compliance across a wide range of resources and locations by extending the Azure control plane. Right from Azure, you can easily organize, govern, and secure Windows, Linux, SQL Servers and Kubernetes clusters across datacenters, edge, and multi-cloud.

- Build Cloud native apps anywhere, at scale Centrally code and deploy applications confidently to any Kubernetes distribution in any location. Accelerate development by using best in class applications services with standardized deployment, configuration, security, and observability.

- Run Azure services anywhere Flexibly use cloud innovation where you need it by deploying Azure services anywhere. Implement cloud practices and automation to deploy faster, consistently, and at scale with always-up-to-date Azure Arc enabled services.

## MicroHack context

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of Azure Arc with a focus on the best practices and the design principles and some interesting challenges for real world scenarios. Specifically, this builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure in your datacenter.

## MicroHack Challenges

### General prerequisites

This MicroHack has a few but important prerequisites to be understood before starting this lab!

* Your own Azure subscription with Owner RBAC rights at the subscription level
  * [Azure Evaluation free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/search/?OCID=AIDcmmzzaokddl_SEM_0fa7acb99db91c1fb85fcfd489e5ca6e:G:s&ef_id=0fa7acb99db91c1fb85fcfd489e5ca6e:G:s&msclkid=0fa7acb99db91c1fb85fcfd489e5ca6e)
* You need to have 2 Virtual Machines ready and updated. One with a Linux Operating System (tested with Ubuntu Server 22.04) and one with Windows Server Operating System (tested with Windows Server 2022). You can use Machines in Azure for this following this Guide: [Azure Arc Jumpstart Servers](https://azurearcjumpstart.io/azure_arc_jumpstart/azure_arc_servers/azure/)
    > **Note**  
    >  When using the Jumpstart the Virtual Machines will already be onboarded to Azure Arc and therefore "Challenge 1 - Azure Arc prerequisites & onboarding" is not needed.
* [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (Hint: Make sure to use the lastest version)
* [Azure PowerShell Guest Configuration Cmdlets](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/machine-configuration/machine-configuration-create-setup#install-the-module-from-the-powershell-gallery)
  * It is not possible to run those commands from Azure Cloud Shell
  * Please make sure you have at least Version 3.4.2 installes with the following Command: ```Install-Module -Name GuestConfiguration -RequiredVersion 3.4.2```
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/download/)

## Challenge 2 - Azure Monitor integration

### Goal

In challenge 2 you will successfully onboard your Windows and Linux Virtual Machines to Azure Monitor using the Azure Monitoring Agent to leverage Azure Update Management, Change Tracking, Inventory and more. Be aware that Microsoft curently shifts from the retiering Log Analytics Agent to Azure Monitoring Agent. By that some of the features used in challange 2 are currently in preview.

### Actions

## Challenge 3 - Access Azure resources using Managed Identities from your on-premises servers

### Goal

Managing secrets, credentials or certificates to secure communication between different services is a main challenge for developers and administrators. Managed Identities is Azure's answer to all these challenges and eliminates the need to manage and securely store secrets, credentials or certificates on the Virtual Machine. In challenge 3 you will leverage Managed Identities via Azure Arc to securely access an Azure Key Vault secret from your Azure Arc enabled servers without the need of managing any credential. 

### Actions

* Create an Azure Key Vault in your Azure resource group
* Create a secret in the Azure Key Vault and assign permissions to your Virtual Machine microhack-arc-servers-lin01
* Access the secret via Bash script

### Success Criteria

* You successfully output the secret in the terminal on your Linux server without providing any credentials (except for your SSH login ðŸ˜Š).

### Learning resources

* [Create a key vault using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal)
* [Set and retrieve a secret from Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal)

## Challenge 4 - Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration with Azure Arc

### Goal

* In this challenge, we will integrate your Azure Arc connected machines with Azure Security Center (ASC). After completing the previous challenges, you should now have an Azure subscription with one or more Azure Arc managed servers. You should also have an available Log Analytics workspace and have deployed the Log Analytics agent to your server(s).

### Actions

* Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Azure Security Center on your Azure Arc connected machines.

### Success criteria

* Open Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Azure Security Center and view the Secure Score for your Azure Arc connected machine.

  * Azure Storage Account
* Setup a Policy that checks if the user "FrodoBaggins" is part of the local administrators group
* Setup a Custom Machine Configuration, for the Windows Server, that creates a registry key in ``` HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment\ ```

### Success criteria
