## MicroHack introduction

What is Azure Arc?

For customers who want to simplify complex and distributed environments across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud, [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-arc/) enables deployment of Azure services anywhere and extends Azure management to any infrastructure. Azure Arc helps you accelerate innovation across hybrid and multi-cloud environments and provides the following benefits to your organization:

![image](./img/AzureArc-01.png)

- Gain central visibility, operations, and compliance Standardize visibility, operationsand compliance across a wide range of resources and locations by extending the Azure control plane. Right from Azure, you can easily organize, govern, and secure Windows, Linux, SQL Servers and Kubernetes clusters across datacenters, edge, and multi-cloud.

- Build Cloud native apps anywhere, at scale Centrally code and deploy applications confidently to any Kubernetes distribution in any location. Accelerate development by using best in class applications services with standardized deployment, configuration, security, and observability.

- Run Azure services anywhere Flexibly use cloud innovation where you need it by deploying Azure services anywhere. Implement cloud practices and automation to deploy faster, consistently, and at scale with always-up-to-date Azure Arc enabled services.

## MicroHack context

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of Azure Arc with a focus on the best practices and the design principles and some interesting challenges for real world scenarios. Specifically, this builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure in your datacenter.

#### Additional:
  * These servers should be able to reach the internet and Azure.
  * You need to have full access and admin or root permissions on these Server OS

* If you need to install and deploy your own server OS from scratch, then, download the following ISO files and save them on your own PC / Environment with your prefered Hypervisor e.g. Hyper-V or Virtualization Client (Windows 10/11 Hyper-V or Virtual Box).
  * [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)
  * [Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022)

* Install from the downloaded ISO your prefered OS. 

#### Using Azure Arc with Azure VMs
* In case you want to use an Azure VM for this MicroHack, you need to follow the guidance 
  * [Evaluate Azure Arc-enabled servers on an Azure virtual machine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/plan-evaluate-on-azure-virtual-machine)

With these prerequisites in place, we can focus on building the differentiated knowledge in the hybrid world with Azure Arc to enable your on-prem, Multi-Cloud environment for the Cloud operations model.

## Challenge 3 - Access Azure resources using Managed Identities from your on-premises servers

## Goal

Managing secrets, credentials or certificates to secure communication between different services is a main challenge for developers and administrators. Managed Identities is Azure's answer to all these challenges and eliminates the need to manage and securely store secrets, credentials or certificates on the Virtual Machine. In challenge 4 you will leverage Managed Identities via Azure Arc to securely access an Azure Key Vault secret from your Azure Arc enabled servers without the need of managing any credential. 

## Actions

* Create an Azure Key Vault in your Azure resource group
* Create a secret in the Azure Key Vault and assign permissions to your Virtual Machine microhack-arc-servers-lin01
* Access the secret via Bash script

## Success Criteria

* You successfully output the secret in the terminal on microhack-arc-servers-lin01 without providing any credentials (except for your SSH login ðŸ˜Š).

4. Defender
   Pre requisits - Enable Defender for Sub
   Check / verify - Recommendations

### Goal

* In this challenge, we will integrate your Azure Arc connected machines with Azure Security Center (ASC). After completing the previous challenges, you should now have an Azure subscription with one or more Azure Arc managed servers. You should also have an available Log Analytics workspace and have deployed the Log Analytics agent to your server(s).

### Actions

* Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Azure Security Center on your Azure Arc connected machines.

### Success criteria

* Open Microsoft Defender for Cloud with Azure Security Center and view the Secure Score for your Azure arc connected machine.

```

### Goal


Challenge 5 is all about interacting with the Client Operating System. We will have a look at Machine Configurations as the final step of this journey.

### Actions

* Setup a Policy that checks if the user "FrodoBaggins" is part of the local administrators group

### Success criteria

* You can view the compliance state of the Administrator Group Policy

### Learning resources

* [Understand the machine configuration feature of Azure Automanage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/machine-configuration/overview)
