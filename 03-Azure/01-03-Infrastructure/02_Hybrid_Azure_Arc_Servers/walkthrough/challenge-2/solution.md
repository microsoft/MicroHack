## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you successfully passed [challenge 1](../../Readme.md#challenge-1) before continuing with this challenge.


### Task 1: Create necessary Azure resources

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2. Create a new Log Analytics Workspace called *mh-arc-servers-automation-law* with default settings in the same Resource Group.

### Task 3: Assign Azure Policy Initiative to your Azure Arc resource group

1. Navigate to *Policy* using the top search bar and select *Assignments* in the left navigation pane.

2. Select *Assignments* in the left navigation pane and go to *Assign initiative*

3. In this section you can now configure the assignment with the following settings and create the assignment:

- Scope: Please select the resource group called *mh-arc-servers-rg*
- Basics: Please search for *[Preview]: Enable Azure Monitor for Hybrid VMs with AMA* and select the initiative.
- Parameters: Please select your Log Analytics workspace. 
- Remediation: Please select the System assigned identity location according to your resources, e.g. West Europe. 

4. Please wait a few seconds until the creation of the assignment is complete. You should see that the initiative is assigned. Every new Azure Arc Server will now automatically install the necessary agents. Be aware that Agent installation can take up to 60 Minutes.

5. Important: Both machines were already onboarded earlier. As a result, you need to create a remediation task to apply the policy to your Azure Arc Servers. Please select the Policy Assignment and select *Create Remediation Task*.

6. Accept the default values, check *Re-evaluate resource compliance before remediating* and repeat the remediation for the following policies:
 - AzureMonitorAgent_Windows_HybridVM_Deploy
 - AzureMonitorAgent_Linux_HybridVM_Deploy
 - DependencyAgentExtension_AMA_Windows_HybridVM_Deploy
 - DependencyAgentExtension_Linux_HybridVM_Deploy
 - VMInsightsDCR_DCRA_HybridVM_Deploy

### Task 4: Enable Update Management for Azure Arc enabled Servers via Azure Policy

1. Navigate to *Policy* using the top search bar and select *Assignments* in the left navigation pane.

2. Select *Assignments* in the left navigation pane and go to *Assign Policy*

3. In this section you can now configure the assignment with the following settings and create the assignment:

- Scope: Please select the resource group called *mh-arc-servers-rg*
- Basics: Please search for *[Preview]: Configure periodic checking for missing system updates on azure Arc-enabled servers* and select the policy.
- Parameters: Skip, and keep defaults. 
- Remediation: Please select the System assigned identity location according to your resources, e.g. West Europe. 

4. Please wait a few seconds until the creation of the assignment is complete. You should see that the policy is assigned.

5. Repeat Step 3 and 4 for the Policy definition *[Preview]: Configure periodic checking for missing system updates on azure Arc-enabled servers*, this time unselecting the Checkbox at Parameters, shifting OS Type to Linux.

6. Important: Both machines were already onboarded earlier. As a result, you need to create a remediation task to apply the policy to your Azure Arc Servers. Please select the Policy Assignment and select *Create Remediation Task*.

7. Accept the default values, check *Re-evaluate resource compliance before remediating* and repeat the remediation for the following policies:
 - Configure periodic checking for missing system updates on azure Arc-enabled servers_1
 - Configure periodic checking for missing system updates on azure Arc-enabled servers_2

8. Verify that all remediation were successful.

9. Navigate to Azure Arc, select Servers, followed by selecting your Windows or Linux Server.

10. Select Updates and click on One-time Update or create a Scheduled Update, if you like to postpone the installation to a later point in time. (follow the wizzard).
