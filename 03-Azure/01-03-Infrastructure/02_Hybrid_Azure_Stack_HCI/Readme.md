This lab is not a full explanation of .... as a technology, please consider the following articles required pre-reading to build foundational knowledge.

Optional (read this after completing this lab to take your learning even deeper!

Describe the scenario here...

# Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will:

- Know how to build a ...
- Understand default ..
- Understand how ..

# Prerequisites

In order to use the MicroHack time most effectively, the following tasks should be completed prior to starting the session.

With these pre-requisites in place, we can focus on building the differentiated knowledge in ... that is required when working with the product, rather than spending hours repeating relatively simple tasks such as setting up Log Analytics 

At the end of this section your base lab build looks as follows:

## Challenge 1 - Deploy the Lab environment

### Goal 

The goal of this exercise is to deploy a simple Azure Sentinel Connector and observe the default behaviour when connecting to it. 

### Task 1: Deploy Baseline

We are going to use a predefined ARM template to deploy the base environment. It will be deployed in to *your* Azure subscription, with resources running in the your specified Azure region.

To start the ARM deployment, follow the steps listed below:

- Login to Azure cloud shell [https://shell.azure.com/](https://shell.azure.com/)
- Ensure that you are operating within the correct subscription via:

`az account show`

- Clone the following GitHub repository 

`git clone Link to Github Repo `

### Task 2: Verify baseline

Now that we have the base lab deployed, we can progress to the ... challenges!
