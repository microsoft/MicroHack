This lab is not a full explanation of Azure Stack HCI as a technology, please consider the following articles required pre-reading to build foundational knowledge.

- [What is Azure Stack HCI?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/overview)
- [Watch a video to see an high level overview of the features from Azure Stack HCI](https://youtu.be/fw8RVqo9dcs)

Optional (read this after completing this lab to take your learning even deeper!

# Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will:

- Know how to build or use Azure Stack HCI
- Understand use cases and possible scenarios in your hybrid world to modernize your infrastructure estate. 

# Prerequisites

!!Eval Lab or own hardware from validated vendors --> See here

!! Hybrid Connectivity !! 

In order to use the MicroHack time most effectively, the following tasks should be completed prior to starting the session.

- Azure Stack HCI Deployment done (Link Eval Lab)
- Download ISO FIles on Azure Stack HCI to location: C:
  - Ubuntu --> Link to ISO for download https://ubuntu.com/download
  - Windows Server 2022 Link to ISO - https://software-static.download.prss.microsoft.com/sg/download/888969d5-f34g-4e03-ac9d-1f9786c66749/SERVER_EVAL_x64FRE_en-us.iso
- 

With these pre-requisites in place, we can focus on building the differentiated knowledge in the hybrid world on Azure Stack HCI to modernize your hybrid estate.
