# Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will:

- Know how to build or use Azure Stack HCI
- Understand use cases and possible scenarios in your hybrid world to modernize your infrastructure estate. 
- Get insights into real world challenges and scenarios

# Prerequisites

For this MicroHack we have a few prerequisites they are very important to be successful in this MicroHack. Normally, for the use of Azure Stack HCI, validated hardware is required from selected partners and such hardware can of course be used for the MicroHack. The alternative is the Azure Stack HCI Evaluation Lab, which allows to convert Azure Stack HCI to Hyper-V with Nested Virtualization.

In order to use the MicroHack time most effectively, the following tasks should be completed prior to starting the session.

- If you do not have own hardware then you need to go through the [Azure Stack HCI Evaluation Lab](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStackHCI-EvalGuide?msclkid=44e04d5fb4e811eca429547b3ced494b) 

- Download ISO FIles on Azure Stack HCI to location for example Cluster Shared Volumes: 
  - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)
  - [Windows Server 2022](https://software-static.download.prss.microsoft.com/sg/download/888969d5-f34g-4e03-ac9d-1f9786c66749/SERVER_EVAL_x64FRE_en-us.iso)

With these pre-requisites in place, we can focus on building the differentiated knowledge in the hybrid world on Azure Stack HCI to modernize your hybrid estate.

# Challenge 2 - Management / control plane fundamentals at the beginning

## Goal

At the beginning it is always a good approach setting up the stage, onboard the necessary infrastructure and management components to have the right focus and support for the next challenges. In this section the focus will be on onboarding the servers we have created in the first challenge and integrate them in the necessary control plane & management tools. 

## Actions

* Create all necessary Azure Resources
  * Azure Resource group (Name: AzStackHCI-MicroHack-Azure)
  * Azure Automation Account (Name: mh-automation)
  * Log Analytics Workspace (Name: mh-la)
* Configure Log Analytics to collect Windows event logs and Linux syslog
* Deploy Azure Policy initiative for automatic onboarding of Azure Arc enabled Servers
* Configure Azure Arc environment


## Success criteria

* You have one Azure resource group containing the Azure Automation Account and Log Analytics Workspace
* You successfully linked the necessary Azure Policy initiative to the Azure resource group
* You have the onboarding scripts for both Windows and Linux servers

## Learning resources

## Actions

* Onboard your three Virtual Machines to Azure Arc using the onboarding scripts
* Enable and configure Update Management
* Enable Inventory 
* Enable VM Insights
* Setup a Policy that checks if the user "FrodoBaggins" is part of the local administrators group

# Challenge 4 - Access Azure resources using Managed Identities from your on-prem servers

## Goal

Managing secrets, credentials or certificates to secure communication between different services is a main challenge for developers and administrators. Managed Identities is Azure's answer to all these challenges and eliminates the need to manage and securely store secrets, credentials or certificates on the Virtual Machine. In challenge 4 you will leverage Managed Identities via Azure Arc to securely access an Azure Key Vault secret from your Azure Arc enabled servers without the need of managing any credential. 

## Actions

* Create an Azure Key Vault in your Azure resource group
* Create a secret in the Azure Key Vault and assign permissions to your Virtual Machine lin-app
* Access the secret via Bash script

## Success Criteria

* You successfully output the secret in the terminal on lin-app without providing any credentials (except for your SSH login ðŸ˜Š).


## Learning resources

* [Create a key vault using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal)
* [Set and retrieve a secret from Azure Key Vault using the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/secrets/quick-create-portal)
* [Use a Linux VM system-assigned managed identity to access Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/tutorial-linux-vm-access-nonaad)


# Challenge 5 - Create Hybrid Fileservices

## Goal

The Goal of this challenge is to show the very common hybrid scenario of fileservices.  
You will learn how to configure the on premises Server and needed Azure Services to create a Hybrid File Service Deployment.  
For this challenge we will use the sever "win-file" you created in [Challenge 1](#challenge-1---first-virtual-machines-on-azure-stack-hci).  

## Actions

* Configure the Server "win-file" to be used as a fileserver
  * Attach and mount data disk
  * Install Fileserver Role and create a share
* Deploy an configure Azure Filesync resources
* Setup sync between the fileserver and the Azure Fileshare

## Success Criteria

* You have a working fileserver on premises
* Azure Filesync will automatically sync Files to Azure Files.
