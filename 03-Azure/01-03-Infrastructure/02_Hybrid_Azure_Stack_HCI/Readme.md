# Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will:

- Know how to build or use Azure Stack HCI
- Understand use cases and possible scenarios in your hybrid world to modernize your infrastructure estate. 
- Get insights into real world challenges and scenarios

# Prerequisites

For this MicroHack we have a few prerequisites they are very important to be successful in this MicroHack. Normally, for the use of Azure Stack HCI, validated hardware is required from selected partners and such hardware can of course be used for the MicroHack. The alternative is the Azure Stack HCI Evaluation Lab, which allows to convert Azure Stack HCI to Hyper-V with Nested Virtualization.

In order to use the MicroHack time most effectively, the following tasks should be completed prior to starting the session.

- If you do not have own hardware then you need to go through the [Azure Stack HCI Evaluation Lab](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStackHCI-EvalGuide?msclkid=44e04d5fb4e811eca429547b3ced494b) 

- Download ISO FIles on Azure Stack HCI to location for example Cluster Shared Volumes: 
  - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)
  - [Windows Server 2022](https://software-static.download.prss.microsoft.com/sg/download/888969d5-f34g-4e03-ac9d-1f9786c66749/SERVER_EVAL_x64FRE_en-us.iso)

With these pre-requisites in place, we can focus on building the differentiated knowledge in the hybrid world on Azure Stack HCI to modernize your hybrid estate.

# MicroHack Challenges 

Before you dive into the challenges please make sure that the pre-requisites are fulfilled otherwise move on with the challenges. [Jump directly to prerequisites to verify](#prerequisites)

## Challenge 1 - First virtual machines on Azure Stack HCI

### Goal 

The goal of this exercise is to deploy the first virtual machines on your Azure Stack HCI. We will use these virtual machines in the next challenges and all other challenges are directly connected to this challenge. 

### Actions

* Create three virtual machines running on your Azure Stack HCI cluster via Windows Admin Center
  * Basic VM configuration: 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 1 disk with 128 GB storage
  * win-app, win-file based on Windows Server 2022 
  * lin-app based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or your prefered Linux distro)
* Join the Windows-based Virtual Machines to Active Directory

[Detailed solution](solution.md)

### Success criteria

* You have two Windows-based Virtual Machines running on your Azure Stack HCI cluster
* You have one Linux-based Virtual Machine running on your Azure Stack HCI cluster
* The Windows-based Virtual Machines are domain-joined and successfully activated
* You can access the Virtual Machines via RDP/SSH

# Challenge 2 - Management / control plane fundamentals at the beginning

### Goal

At the beginning it is always a good approach setting up the stage, onboard the necessary infrastructure and management components to have the right focus and support for the next challenges. In this section the focus will be on onboarding the servers we have created in the first challenge and integrate them in the necessary control plane & management tools. 

### Actions

* Create all necessary Azure Resources
  * Azure Resource group (Name: AzStackHCI-MicroHack-Azure)
  * Azure Automation Account (Name: mh-automation)
  * Log Analytics Workspace (Name: mh-la)
* Configure Log Analytics to collect Windows event logs and Linux syslog
* Deploy Azure Policy initiative for automatic onboarding of Azure Arc enabled Servers
* Configure Azure Arc environment

### Success criteria

* You have one Azure resource group containing the Azure Automation Account and Log Analytics Workspace
* You successfully linked the necessary Azure Policy initiative to the Azure resource group
* You have the onboarding scripts for both Windows and Linux servers

# Challenge 4 - Access Azure resources using Managed Identities from your on-prem servers

### Goal

Managing secrets, credentials or certificates to secure communication between different services is a main challenge for developers and administrators. Managed Identities is Azure's answer to all these challenges and eliminates the need to manage and securely store secrets, credentials or certificates on the Virtual Machine. In challenge 4 you will leverage Managed Identities via Azure Arc to securely access an Azure Key Vault secret from your Azure Arc enabled servers without the need of managing any credential. 

### Actions

* Create an Azure Key Vault in your Azure resource group
* Create a secret in the Azure Key Vault and assign permissions to your Virtual Machine lin-app
* Access the secret via Bash script



### Success Criteria

* You successfully output the secret in the terminal on lin-app without providing any credentials (except for your SSH login ðŸ˜Š).


### Learning resources

# Challenge 5 - Create Hybrid Fileservices

## Goal

The Goal of this challenge is to show the very common hybrid scenario of Fileservices.  
You will learn how to configure the on premises Server and needed Azure Service to create a Hybrid File Service Deployment.

## Task 1: Configure the on premises Fileserver

For this challenge we will use one of the servers you created in [Challenge 1](#challenge-1---first-virtual-machines-on-azure-stack-hci).  
First start by adding a Data Disk to the Server "win-file".  
After this install the Fileserver Role on the Server.   

With a Working Fileserver you can create some demo data in your share. (Like text or office documents)
