# **MicroHack Azure Arc - Part I**

[toc]

## MicroHack introduction

What is Azure Arc?

For customers who want to simplify complex and distributed environments across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud, [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-arc/) enables deployment of Azure services anywhere and extends Azure management to any infrastructure. Azure Arc helps you accelerate innovation across hybrid and multi-cloud environments and provides the following benefits to your organization:

![image](./IMG/AzureArc-01.png)

- Gain central visibility, operations, and compliance Standardize visibility, operationsand compliance across a wide range of resources and locations by extending the Azure control plane. Right from Azure, you can easily organize, govern, and secure Windows, Linux, SQL Servers and Kubernetes clusters across datacenters, edge, and multi-cloud.

- Build Cloud native apps anywhere, at scale Centrally code and deploy applications confidently to any Kubernetes distribution in any location. Accelerate development by using best in class applications services with standardized deployment, configuration, security, and observability.

- Run Azure services anywhere Flexibly use cloud innovation where you need it by deploying Azure services anywhere. Implement cloud practices and automation to deploy faster, consistently, and at scale with always-up-to-date Azure Arc enabled services.

## MicroHack context

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of Azure Arc with a focus on the best practices and the design principles and some interesting challenges for real world scenarios. Specifically, this builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure in your datacenter.

## Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will:

* Know how to use Azure Arc in your environment, on-prem or Multi-cloud
* Understand use cases and possible scenarios in your hybrid world to modernize your infrastructure estate
* Get insights into real world challenges and scenarios

## Prerequisites

This MicroHack has a few but very important prerequisites to be understood before starting this lab!

For Arc enabled Servers

* Have an server, windows or linux ready
For windows, pls use if possible Windows Server 2019 or 2022 with the latest patch level

  [Supported operating systems @ Connected Machine agent prerequisites - Azure Arc | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/servers/prerequisites#supported-operating-systems)
	
  This Server OS could be hosted as a VM on VMware, Hyper-V, Nutanix, AWS, GCP or bare metal.
	
Additional:
  * These servers should be able to reach the internet and Azure.
  * You need to have full access and admin or root permissions on these Server OS
	

For Arc enabled Kubernetes
	
* Prepare your familiar kubernetes distribution. To check if this distribution is valid for [Azure Arc enbaled Kubernetes, please check here Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes validation - Azure Arc | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/validation-program)


* If you need to install and deploy your own server OS from scratch, then, download the following ISO files and save them on your own PC / Environment with your prefered Hypervisor e.g. Hyper-V or Virtualization Client (Windows 10/11 Hyper-V or Virtual Box).
  * [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)
  * [Windows Server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022)

Install from the downloaded ISO your prefered OS. 

With these prerequisites in place, we can focus on building the differentiated knowledge in the hybrid world with Azure Arc to enable your on-prem, Multi-Cloud environment for the Cloud operations model.

## Lab environment for this MicroHack

## Architecture

The [Azure Stack HCI Evaluation Guide](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStackHCI-EvalGuide) will help you to deploy the foundation for this MicroHack. After successfully completing the guide you will have a two-node Azure Stack HCI cluster running on an Azure VM with nested virtualization enabled. This two-node cluster will represent your on-premises location and is tightly integrated with Azure.
