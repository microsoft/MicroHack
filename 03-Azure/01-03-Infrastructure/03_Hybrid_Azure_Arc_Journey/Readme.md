# **MicroHack Azure Arc - Part I**

[toc]

## MicroHack introduction and context

What is Azure Arc?

For customers who want to simplify complex and distributed environments across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud, [Azure Arc](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-arc/) enables deployment of Azure services anywhere and extends Azure management to any infrastructure. Azure Arc helps you accelerate innovation across hybrid and multi-cloud environments and provides the following benefits to your organization:

![image](./img/AzureArc-01.png)

	â€¢ Gain central visibility, operations, and compliance â€“ Standardize visibility, operations, and compliance across a wide range of resources and locations by extending the Azure control plane. Right from Azure, you can easily organize, govern, and secure Windows, Linux, SQL Servers and Kubernetes clusters across datacenters, edge, and multi-cloud.

	â€¢ Build Cloud native apps anywhere, at scale â€“ Centrally code and deploy applications confidently to any Kubernetes distribution in any location. Accelerate development by using best in class applications services with standardized deployment, configuration, security, and observability.

	â€¢ Run Azure services anywhere â€“ Flexibly use cloud innovation where you need it by deploying Azure services anywhere. Implement cloud practices and automation to deploy faster, consistently, and at scale with always-up-to-date Azure Arc enabled services.

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of Azure Arc with a focus on the best practices and the design principles and some interesting challenges for real world scenarios. Specifically, this builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure in your datacenter.

## Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will:

* Know how to build or use Azure Stack HCI
* Understand use cases and possible scenarios in your hybrid world to modernize your infrastructure estate
* Get insights into real world challenges and scenarios

## Prerequisites

This MicroHack has a few but very important prerequisites to be understood before starting this lab!
Usually, validated hardware from selected _Original Equipment Manufacturers_ (OEMs) is required to successfully deploy Azure Stack HCI. While this requires time and effort, we leverage Azure's nested virtualization feature instead of setting up a test environment for this MicroHack. In order to reduce the preparation time for this MicroHack, we use the [Azure Stack HCI Evaluation Guide](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStackHCI-EvalGuide) as a starting point.

[comment]: # (It is not clear where I'd find the Cluster Shared Volume. Also, do I have to download Ubuntu and WS22K for the virtual instance?)

In order to use the MicroHack time most effectively, the following tasks must be completed prior to starting the session:

* If you do not have your own hardware, go through the [Azure Stack HCI Evaluation Guide](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStackHCI-EvalGuide) and follow the instructions to set up a test environment in your Azure subscription.
* Then, download the following ISO files and save them to the _Cluster Shared Volumes_ of your Azure Stack HCI cluster:
  * [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)
  * [Windows Server 2022](https://software-static.download.prss.microsoft.com/sg/download/888969d5-f34g-4e03-ac9d-1f9786c66749/SERVER_EVAL_x64FRE_en-us.iso)

With these prerequisites in place, we can focus on building the differentiated knowledge in the hybrid world on Azure Stack HCI to modernize your hybrid estate.

## Lab environment for this MicroHack

## Architecture

The [Azure Stack HCI Evaluation Guide](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStackHCI-EvalGuide) will help you to deploy the foundation for this MicroHack. After successfully completing the guide you will have a two-node Azure Stack HCI cluster running on an Azure VM with nested virtualization enabled. This two-node cluster will represent your on-premises location and is tightly integrated with Azure.

As you can see, the target architecture is missing a lot of things. You are tasked to complete all challenges to finish the MicroHack.

## MicroHack Challenges

Before you dive into the challenges, please make sure that the prerequisites are fulfilled. [Jump directly to prerequisites to verify](#prerequisites)

## Challenge 1 - Create virtual machines on Azure Stack HCI

### Challenge 1 Goal

The goal of this exercise is to deploy the first virtual machines on your Azure Stack HCI cluster. We will use these virtual machines in the following challenges for different purposes.

### Actions

* Create three virtual machines running on your Azure Stack HCI cluster via Windows Admin Center
  * Basic VM configuration: 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 1 disk with 128 GB storage
  * win-app, win-file based on Windows Server 2022
  * lin-app based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or your preferred Linux distro)
* Join the Windows-based Virtual Machines to Active Directory

### Success criteria

* You have two Windows-based Virtual Machines running on your Azure Stack HCI cluster
* You have one Linux-based Virtual Machine running on your Azure Stack HCI cluster
* The Windows-based Virtual Machines are domain-joined and successfully activated
* You can access the Virtual Machines via RDP/SSH

### Learning resources

* [Get started with Azure Stack HCI and Windows Admin Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/get-started)
* [Manage VMs with Windows Admin Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/manage/vm)

## Challenge 2 - Management / control plane fundamentals at the beginning

### Challenge 2 Goal

At the beginning it is always a good approach setting up the stage, onboard the necessary infrastructure and management components to have the right focus and support for the next challenges.
