# üöÄ Deploying the Lab environment and an N-tier App

## Introduction
This guide will walk you through deploying a ready-to-go N-tier application and additional resources you need for this lab using the Awesome Azure Developer CLI and Azure Copilot. 
We will use Awesome Azure Developer CLI to deploy a ready-to-go N-tier application. Azure Copilot will help us with what to do and will answer our questions, if we have any.

## Prerequisites
- üîë Azure Subscription
- üõ†Ô∏è Azure Developer CLI installed (pre-installed in CloudShell - no further action needed)
- üìö Basic knowledge of Azure services

## Lab Environment & the N-tier Application

To experiment with Azure Monitor & BCDR Solutions and learn how to use it, a lab environment is provided. This includes a sample application, several virtual machines and other Azure services to generate telemetry data.

## 1. Initialize the Templates for the N-tier Application
Use the Awesome Azure Developer CLI to initialize the environment.

```bash
azd auth login
```

```bash
azd init --template Azure-Samples/todo-python-mongo-swa-func
```

## 2. Deploy the N-tier Application
Use the Awesome Azure Developer CLI to deploy the N-tier application.

```bash
azd up
```

Use the Awesome Azure Developer CLI to check the status of your deployment.

## 3. Access the Application
Retrieve the URL of the deployed application and open it in your web browser.
