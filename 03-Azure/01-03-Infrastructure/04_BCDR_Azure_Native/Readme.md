## MicroHack introduction

### What is Business Continuity?

When you design for resiliency, you must understand your availability requirements.
- How much downtime is acceptable? 
- How much will potential downtime cost your business?
- How much should you invest in making the application highly available?
- You also must define what it means for the application to be available.

ðŸ’¡ For example, is the application "down" if you can submit an order but the system cannot process it within the normal timeframe? Also consider the probability of an outage occurring and whether a mitigation strategy is cost-effective. Resilience planning starts with business requirements. Here are some approaches for thinking about resiliency in those terms

The following picture describes very well the individual levels / disaster recovery tier levels and gives an overview of which topics we should deal with when talking about disaster recovery. The individual terms, terminologies and categories are explained and this microhack also gives an approach and a few tips on how to deal with them in your own company.

## MicroHack context

This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of building a Business Continuity Strategy with a focus on the best practices and the design principles and some interesting challenges for real world scenarios. Specifically, this builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure in your datacenter.

## Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will:

* Know how to use the right business continuity strategy for your infrastructure or your particular workload
* Understand use cases and possible scenarios in your business continuity & disaster recovery strategy 
* Get insights into real world challenges and scenarios

## MicroHack Challenges

### General prerequisites

This MicroHack has a few but important prerequisites to be understood before starting this lab!

* Your own Azure subscription with Owner RBAC rights at the subscription level
  * [Azure Evaluation free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/search/?OCID=AIDcmmzzaokddl_SEM_0fa7acb99db91c1fb85fcfd489e5ca6e:G:s&ef_id=0fa7acb99db91c1fb85fcfd489e5ca6e:G:s&msclkid=0fa7acb99db91c1fb85fcfd489e5ca6e)
* More will be added later if needed

## Challenge 0 - Understand the Disaster Recovery terms and define a strategy

If you have already worked at the senior level or have been working in IT for many years, you may be able to skip this intro challenge. These standards should be defined in every organization and the most important thing is that the Business Continuity Management and the necessary steps for disaster recovery are regularly tested.

### Goal

The goal from this challenge is to understand the challenges in business continuity management and the most important terms. Second dimension is to define strategy and to put yourself into different roles to view the area from different perspectives.

1. What exactly is the difference between Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity?
2. Who is responsible for BCDR?
3. Is there a difference between High availability & Disaster Recovery?
4. Do I really need Backup & Disaster Recovery?

### Actions

* Write down the first 3 steps you would go for if your company got attacked by ransomware
* Think about if you ever participated in a business continuity test scenario
* Put yourself in the position of an application owner and define the necessary steps to make sure your application stays available in case of a disaster
* Who defines the requirements for Business Continuity and what are the necessary KPIÂ´s for an application to reach a good SLA in terms of availability?
* Define and write down four different categories of Disaster Recovery Tier Levels that applications can use incl. the availability SLA
* Plan the different geographic regions you need to use for reaching the highest availability SLA (can also include your datacenter locations)

### Success criteria

* Understood the different terms from BCDR
* Noted the first three steps after ransomware attack in you company
* Thought about the last successful disaster recovery of the daily used applications
* Noted the responsibilities and the roles in the company you are working
* Defined four level of disaster recovery categories incl. availability SLA
