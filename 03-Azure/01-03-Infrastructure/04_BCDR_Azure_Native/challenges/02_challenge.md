## Challenge 2 - Regional Protection and Disaster Recovery (DR)

### Goal 🎯

* Protect in Azure - **Backup / Restore**
* Protect in Azure with **Disaster Recover (DR)** within a Region

In this challenge, you will learn how to back up and restore your Linux Virtual Machine using Azure's Recovery Services Vault. You will also practice simulating a regional failover between two datacenters to handle a regional failure, such as a datacenter outage.

## Actions

### Challenge 2.1 - Protect in Azure - Backup / Restore
1. Enable Azure Backup for the Linux VM in the primary region.
2. Enable Azure Backup for Blobs
3. Restore a VM in Azure.

### Challenge 2.2 - Protect in Azure with Disaster Recover (DR) within an Azure Region
2. Set up disaster recovery for the Linux VM in the primary region.
3. Simulate a failover from one part of the primary region to another part within the same region.

### Success Criteria ✅

- You have successfully set up Azure Backup Policies for both virtual machines.
- You have successfully restored a VM of your choice to Azure.
- You have successfully configured replication between two availability zones and simulated a failover between two datacenters using Azure Site Recovery.
