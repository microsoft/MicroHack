## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you successfully passed [challenge 1](../../Readme.md#challenge-1) before continuing with this challenge.

In this challenge you will learn how to setup Azure Backup to Protect a Virtual Machine in Azure. In addition we will have a look on the configuration and necessary Backup Policies that are available.

Actions:

- Deploy a Windows Server 2022 VM in West Europe Resource Group
- Deploy a Ubuntu Server VM in North Europe Resource Group
- Enable Azure Backup for both VMs
- Restore a VM in Azure


### Task 1: Create a new Virtual Machine in Azure Region Western Europe

As a first step, we will create a VM (Name: server01) in Azure in the resource group "mh-bcdr-weu-rg" that we created in the last challenge. This should be a Windows Server 2022 (Azure Edition) using a VM Type of Standard DS1v2.
