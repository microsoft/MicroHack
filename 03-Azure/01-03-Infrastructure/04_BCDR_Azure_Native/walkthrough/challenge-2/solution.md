‚è∞ Duration: 1 Hour

üìã [Challenge 2 Instructions](../../challenges/02_challenge.md)

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have successfully completed [challenge 1](../../challenges/01_challenge.md) before proceeding.


### Challenge 2.1 - Protect in Azure - Backup / Restore
In this challenge, you will onboard your Linux Virtual Machine to a centralized Recovery Services Vault and use Azure Backup Center to protect it with Azure Backup.

* Task 1: Enable Azure Backup for Linux VM.
* Task 2: Enable Azure Backup for Blobs.
* Task 3: Restore a VM in Azure.

If you have not created the Linux Machine successfully, follow this guide to create it on the portal:
