## Create a Distributed firewall

Use the VMs that you migrated in the last step to create a distributed firewall rule between the 2 VMs.

Workload-1-1-1 & Workload-1-1-2

1.	From your browser, log in with admin privileges to an NSX Manager at https://10.83.0.3

2.	Go to Inventory > Groups > Add Group 
 
3.	Add a group name as Application1 and then press Set Members

4.	Add the IP of Workload-1-1-1 VM IP to this group and the press apply

5.	Then press save button

6.	Now create a second Application group and click set members

7.	Click the IP addresses and then provide the IP address of the AVS Workload-1-1-2 VM and then press apply

8.	Select Security > Distributed Firewall from the navigation panel.

9.	Click Add Policy

12.	Set source for the rule by selecting the first Application group and then press apply

13.	Set destination for the rule by selecting the first Application group and then press apply

14.	Keep the action as Allow and then press publish

15.	One you firewall rule has been published, ping the Workload-1-1-2 VM from Workload-1-1-2 VM. We should notice that the ping is going through

16.	Now come back to the distributed firewall and set the action to reject

17.	Now ping the Workload-1-1-2 VM from Workload-1-1-1 VM. We should notice that the ping is blocked. Note: vm credentials are user: root password: 1TestVM!

This proves the distributed firewall rule between the 2 application groups
