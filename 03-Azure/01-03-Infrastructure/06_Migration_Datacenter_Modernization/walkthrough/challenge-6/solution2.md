Azure App Service bulk migration capabilities are now in public preview through the Azure Migrate feature:

* Discover and assess ASP.NET web apps in addition to categorizing which apps are ready for migration.
* Suggest a destination for migration and provide a guided content and configuration experience for ASP.NET web apps to Azure App Service.
