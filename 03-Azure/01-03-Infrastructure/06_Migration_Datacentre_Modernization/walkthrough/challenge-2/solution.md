### **Task 2: Deploy Azure Migrate Appliance**

To start physical server discovery you must install the Azure Migrate Appliance on your on-premises. The Azure Migrate Appliance can be downloaded as a OVA or VHD template or you can download a ZIP file containing a PowerShell script to install it on a already existing server. For the purpose of this MicroHack we will install the Azure Migrate Appliance via the PowerShell script on a Windows Server 2022 system.
