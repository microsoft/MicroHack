Duration: 40 minutes

## Prerequisites

Please make sure thet you successfully completed [Challenge 3](../challenge-3/solution.md) before continuing with this challenge.

### **Task 1: Create a machine group**

You group servers together to assess whether they are suitable for migration to Azure and to get size and cost estimates for Azure.

Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the previousley created Azure Migrate project. Select *Servers, databases and web apps*, make sure that the right Azure Migrate Project is selected and click *Overview*.

The Azure VM assessment overview provides details about:

* Azure readiness: Whether servers are suitable for migration to Azure.
* Monthly cost estimation: The estimated monthly compute and storage costs for running the VMs in Azure.
* Monthly storage cost estimation: Estimated costs for disk storage after migration.

ðŸ’¡ Please note that confidence rating for the assessment is marked as low. This is due to missing or to less performance data. It is recommended that you collect performance data via the Azure Migrate appliance at least on day before creating the assessment.
