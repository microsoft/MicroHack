# Walkthrough Challenge 5 - Migrate machines to Azure

Duration: 40 minutes

## Prerequisites

Please make sure thet you successfully completed [Challenge 4](../challenge-4/solution.md) before continuing with this challenge.

### **Task 1: Create and prepare Windows Server 2019 for the Azure Replication Appliance**

To start physical server migration you must install the Azure Replication Appliance on your on-premises. The Azure Replication Appliance can be downloaded as a OVA template or you can download the appliance installer to install it on a already existing server. For the purpose of this MicroHack we will install the Azure Replication Appliance via the installer on a new Windows Server 2019 system.

ðŸ’¡ Please make sure to check the [prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-replication-appliance) of the Azure 
Replication Appliance.

ðŸ’¡ Please note that it is currently [not supported](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/common-questions-appliance#can-the-azure-migrate-appliancereplication-appliance-connect-to-the-same-vcenter) to install the Azure Migrate Replication Appliance on the same system as the Azure Migrate Appliance.

In the Azure Portal select *Virtual machines* from the navigation pane on the left. Select *Create -> Azure virtual machine*

Under Basics select the *source-rg* Resource Group and provide a name for the server. Select *Windows Server 2019 Datacenter - x64 Gen2* for the Image.

![image](./img/azreplapl2.png)

ðŸ’¡ For the Username and Password you can either select a combination of your choice or check the secrets within the KeyVault.

Add an additional 1024GiB Standard HDD LRS data disk to the Virtual Machine and click *Next*

![image](./img/azreplapl2-1.png)

![image](./img/azreplapl2-2.png)

In the *Networking* tab, select the *source-vnet* Virtual Network and the *source-subnet* Subnet and make sure to select *None* for the Public IP and NIC network security group.

![image](./img/azreplapl3.png)

Accept the default settings for the remaining tabs, select *Review + create* and click *Create*.

![image](./img/azreplapl4.png)

Wait until the deployment has been successfully completed and select *Go to resource*

![image](./img/azreplapl5.png)

Select *Bastion* from the navigation pane on the left, provide the credentials to login to the Azure Migrate Replication VM and select *Connect*. A new browser tab should open with a remote session to the Windows Server 2019 system.

![image](./img/azreplapl6.png)

ðŸ’¡ You can also select *Password from Azure KeyVault* under *Authentication Type* if you set the password during VM creation to match the secret stored in the KeyVault.


### **Task 2: Setup the Azure Replication Appliance**

To prepare for physical server migration, you need to verify the physical server settings, and prepare to deploy a replication appliance.

Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) on the Azure Replication Appliance using the Microsoft Edge browser and navigate to the previousley created Azure Migrate project. Select *Servers, databases and web apps*, make sure that the right Azure Migrate Project is selected and click *Discover* in the *Migration tools* box.

![image](./img/mig1.png)

Select *Physical or other...* in the *Are your machines virtualized* drop down and select *West Europe* as the *Target Region*.
Make sure to check the confirmation checkbox and click *Create resources*. 

![image](./img/mig2.png)

Wait until the deployment has been successfully completed. Next under *1. Download and install the repliaction appliance software* click *Download* to download the Azure Migrate Repplication Appliance installer. 
You also need to download the registration key that is required to register the replication appliance under *2. Configure the replication appliance and register it to the project*.

![image](./img/mig3.png)

Next start the installation of the Azure Migrate Replication Appliance by double cklicking the *MicrosoftAzureSiteRecoveryUnifiedSetup.exe*

![image](./img/mig4.png)

Select *Install the configuration server and process server* and click *Next*

![image](./img/mig5.png)

Check the *I acceppt...* checkbox and click *Next*

![image](./img/mig6.png)

Browse and select the previousley downloaded registration key and click *Next*

![image](./img/mig7.png)

Accept the default *Internet connection* configuration

![image](./img/mig8.png)

Review the prerequisites check of the installer. Note that you can safely ignore the static IP warning.

![image](./img/mig9.png)

Specify the required passwords and note the password requirements. 

ðŸ’¡ For the Passwords you can either select your choice or check the secrets within the KeyVault to reuse the password.

![image](./img/mig10.png)

Select *No* for *Do you want to protect VMware virtual machines* and click *Next*

![image](./img/mig11.png)

Verify the *Install location*. The installer should automatically pre-select the largest disk, in our case the 1024 GiB data disk that was created during VM creation.

![image](./img/mig12.png)

Select the appropriate NICs (We only have 1 in our case).

![image](./img/mig13.png)

Verify the installation summary and click *Install* to start the installation.

![image](./img/mig14.png)

Wait until the installation progress is finished.

![image](./img/mig15.png)

After the successfull installation a configuration server connection passphrase will be displayed. Copy the passphrase and save it as a new secret in the source-rg Resource Group KeyVault.

![image](./img/mig17.png)

After the installation completes, the Appliance configuration wizard will be launched automatically.
You can add the local administrator account credentials of the source servers (stored secrets in the source KeyVault).

![image](./img/mig17-1.png)

The last step is to finalize the registration. Refresh the Azure Portal page where you've downloaded the installer and registration keys and select the *azreplappliance* from the drop down list and click on *Finalize registration*.

### **Task 3: Install the Mobility service on the source server**

On machines you want to migrate, you need to install the Mobility service agent. The agent installers are available on the replication appliance in the *%ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\pushinstallsvc\repository* directory.
To install the Mobility service agent on the Windows machines follow the following steps

1. Sign in to the replication appliance.
2. Navigate to %ProgramData%\ASR\home\svsystems\pushinstallsvc\repository.
3. Find the installer for the machine operating system and version. Review [supported operating systems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/vmware-physical-azure-support-matrix#replicated-machines).
4. Copy the installer file to the machine you want to migrate.

**Windows**

5. Make sure that you have the passphrase that was generated when you deployed the appliance (You should have saved it as a KeyVault secret).
  * Store the key in a temporary text file and copy the file into the same direcotry on the source machines.
  * You can obtain the passphrase on the replication appliance. From the command line, run the following command to view the passphrase
     C:\ProgramData\ASR\home\svsystems\bin\genpassphrase.exe -v

![image](./img/maw2.png)

  * ðŸ’¥ Don't regenerate the passphrase. This will break connectivity and you will have to reregister the replication appliance.

#### **Task 3.1: Install the Mobility service on the Windows VMs**

1. Extract the contents of installer file to a local folder (for example C:\Temp) on the machine, as follows:

     ren Microsoft-ASR_UA\*Windows\*release.exe MobilityServiceInstaller.exe
     
     MobilityServiceInstaller.exe /q /x:C:\Temp\Extracted

     cd C:\Temp\Extracted

2. Run the Mobility Service Installer:

     UnifiedAgent.exe /Role "MS" /Platform "VmWare" /Silent

ðŸ’¡ You need to specify *VmWare* for the *Platform* parameter also for physical servers.

3. Register the agent with the replication appliance:

     cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\agent

     UnifiedAgentConfigurator.exe /CSEndPoint <replication appliance IP address> /PassphraseFilePath <Passphrase File Path>

**ðŸ’¥ Repeat the above steps for the second Windows Server**
