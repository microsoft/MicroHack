Duration: 40 minutes

## Prerequisites

Please make sure thet you successfully completed [Challenge 4](../challenge-4/solution.md) before continuing with this challenge.

### **Task 1: Create and prepare Windows Server 2019 for the Azure Replication Appliance**

To start physical server migration you must install the Azure Replication Appliance on your on-premises. The Azure Replication Appliance can be downloaded as a OVA template or you can download the appliance installer to install it on a already existing server. For the purpose of this MicroHack we will install the Azure Replication Appliance via the PowerShell script on a new Windows Server 2019 system.

ðŸ’¡ Please make sure to check the [prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-replication-appliance) of the Azure 
Replication Appliance.

ðŸ’¡ Please note that it is currently [not supported](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/common-questions-appliance#can-the-azure-migrate-appliancereplication-appliance-connect-to-the-same-vcenter) to install the Azure Migrate Replication Appliance on the same system as the Azure Migrate Appliance.

In the Azure Portal select *Virtual machines* from the navigation pane on the left. Select *Create -> Azure virtual machine*

ðŸ’¡ You can also select *Password from Azure KeyVault* under *Authentication Type* if you set the password during VM creation to match the secret stored in the KeyVault.


### **Task 2: Setup the Azure Replication Appliance**

To prepare for physical server migration, you need to verify the physical server settings, and prepare to deploy a replication appliance.

Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) on the Azure Replication Appliance using the Microsoft Edge browser and navigate to the previousley created Azure Migrate project. Select *Servers, databases and web apps*, make sure that the right Azure Migrate Project is selected and click *Discover* in the *Migration tools* box.
