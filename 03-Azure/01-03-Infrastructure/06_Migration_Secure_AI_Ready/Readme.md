# MicroHack introduction

This MicroHack scenario walks through the process how to optimize and modernize you datacenter. The assessment, the tooling and processes are global best practices and with a focus on the real world scenarios, cost optimization and the best customer recommended design principles. Specifically, this builds up to include working with an existing infrastructure.

# MicroHack context
This MicroHack scenario walks through the use of Azure Migrate to support the process and the different phases of datacenter modernization: 

- Discover
- Decide
- Assess
- Migrate
- Modernize

As part of the MicroHack, we will simulate the discovery and migration of physical servers to Azure. We will create the source systems as Azure Virtual Machines within a dedicated source Resource Group in Azure to simulate the on-prem datacenter. We will use Azure Migrate to discover, assess and migrate the systems into a destination Resource Group that simulates the target Azure environment.

The concept behind physical server discovery and migration is described in detail under the following links:
* [Physical Server discovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-physical)
* [Physical Server migration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/migrate-support-matrix-physical-migration)

# Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will:

- Know how to build an assessment & business case for you datacenter transformation 
- Understand the default and best practices how to quickly migrate workloads and safe with right sizing
- Understand how to use the tools and best practices to optimize and safe time
- Know how to not only use the tools to Lift & Shift, you will also understand how to modernize to cloud native services

## Challenge 3 - Create a Business Case

The Business case capability helps you build a business proposal to understand how Azure can bring the most value to your business. 

It highlights:

- On-premises vs Azure total cost of ownership.
- Year on year cashflow analysis.
- Resource utilization based insights to identify servers and workloads that are ideal for cloud.
- Quick wins for migration and modernization including end of support Windows OS and SQL versions.
- Long term cost savings by moving from a capital expenditure model to an Operating expenditure model, by paying for only what you use.

Other key features:

- Helps remove guess work in your cost planning process and adds data insights driven calculations.
- It can be generated in just a few clicks after you have performed discovery using the Azure Migrate appliance.
- The feature is automatically enabled for existing Azure Migrate projects.
