### **Task 3: Adjust business case assumptions**

The business case is calculated based on some [assumptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/concepts-business-case-calculation#total-cost-of-ownership-steady-state). To better fit your current scenario, you can adjust those assumptions.

**Azure cost**
