The migration should complete successfully. You can now click on _Go to your website_ to open the migrated web app now running on Azure App Services.

Change back to the Azure Portal and open the Resource Group _destination-rg_. You should now see a App Service and a App Service Plan resource. Click on the App Service and select _Browse_ to open your web app again.

### **Task 2: Update Traffic Manager profile**

The Traffic Manager profile is still pointing to the previousley migrated Virtual Machines. You can now update the endpoints within the profile to point to the App Services instead of the VMs.

From the Azure Portal open the Load Balancing blade, select Traffic Manager on the navigation pane and select the previously created _tfp-frontend_ Traffic Manager profile. Select _Endpoints_ and click _Add_.

Select _Azure endpoint_, provide a name, select _App Service_ and select the previousley created App Service.

![image](./img/tfupdate2.png)

Next delete the endpoints for the Virtual Machines.

You can now browse to the Traffic Manager profile. Again, from a user perspective nothing changed but you are now browsing the web site content that is hosted on Azure App Service instead of Virtual Machines.
