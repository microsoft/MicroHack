   - **Pricing tier**: Select Standard S0.
4. Keep Network and tags by default, then select **Create**.
5. Wait for the deployment to complete, and then select **Go to resource**.

### **Task 2: Deploy a GPT-4.1 model**
In this task, we will deploy a GPT-4.1 model in the Azure OpenAI Service.
1. In your Azure OpenAI resource, select **Deployments** from the left-hand menu.
2. Select **+ Deploy model** to create a new deployment. Choose deploy base model in the dropdown.
3. On the **Select deployment** page, search for the GPT-4.1 model and click confirm:

7. Give context to the model by entering a prompt in the text box. For example, you can enter:
   ```
   You are an expert in cloud computing. Explain the benefits of using Azure OpenAI Service for natural language processing tasks.
   ```
    Then click **Apply Changes**.
8. Observe the response generated by the model in the output section. You can modify the prompt and experiment with different inputs to see how the model responds.

### **Task 3: Integrate Azure OpenAI with a Web Application**
In this task, we will integrate the Azure OpenAI Service with a simple web application.
1. In the playground window, click on the **Deploy** button at the top left corner, and select **...as a web app**.
2. On the **Deploy to a web app** page, enter the following information:
   - Select **Update an existing web app**.

   - Click deploy.
3. Once the deployment is complete, navigate to the web app URL provided in the deployment confirmation
4. Test the web application by entering a prompt in the input field and clicking the submit button. The application should send the prompt to the Azure OpenAI Service and display the response on the web page.
