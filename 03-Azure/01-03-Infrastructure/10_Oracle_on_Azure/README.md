# MicroHack introduction

This MicroHack scenario will help you get hands-on experience migrating Oracle databases from on-premises to different Azure Services.

![image](Path to the high level architecture )

This lab is not a full explanation of .... as a technology, please consider the following articles required pre-reading to build foundational knowledge.

Optional (read this after completing this lab to take your learning even deeper!)

Describe the scenario here...

# MicroHack context

In this microhack you will solve a common challenge for companies migrating to the cloud: migrating Oracle databases to Azure.  

# Objectives

After completing this MicroHack you will:

- Perform a pre-migration assessment of the databases looking at size, database engine type, database version, etc.
- Use Tools to perform an online migration
- Do cutover and validation to ensure the application is working properly with the new configuration
