# Discovery and pre-assessment of Oracle database 

Oracle provides extended performance reports for their databases. Depending on the used database and available licenses you can choose between

1. Automatic Workload Repository Reports so called AWR's 
2. Statspack Report

For the discovery of Oracle databases we are created a parsing solution called ATROPOSS. The solution is running completely inside the browser. So, no backend is involved. The discovery of the reports can be extended with the outputs of RVTools and CSV outputs of SQL scripts. 

Information about the web tool ATROPOSS is available under the following online URL's.
