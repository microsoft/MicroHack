# Replicate Oracle XE Table to PostgreSQL

This Python script replicates changes from an Oracle XE database to a PostgreSQL database. It uses the cx_Oracle library to connect to Oracle and the psycopg2 library to connect to PostgreSQL. The script fetches changes from an Oracle audit table and applies them to a corresponding table in PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.x
Oracle Instant Client
cx_Oracle library
psycopg2 library
