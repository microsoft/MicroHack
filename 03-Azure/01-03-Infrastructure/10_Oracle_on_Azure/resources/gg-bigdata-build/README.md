# GoldenGate Installation

Hello I need you to build based on the following instruction https://blogs.oracle.com/coretec/post/running-goldengate-23ai-on-kubernetes an docker container for "GoldenGate for Distributed Applications and Analytics". Follow the instructions mentioned on the link. I already downloaded the corresponding zip file "V1043090-01.zip" into the workspace. Change the default password to "Welcome1234#". Upload the docker image to the Azure Container Registry "/subscriptions/09808f31-065f-4231-914d-776c2d6bbe34/resourceGroups/odaa/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/odaamh". Run the container in Azure Kubernetes Service /subscriptions/ff0bb075-6c44-44ee-bb64-d46ce828c62f/resourceGroups/odaa1/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/odaa1.
Note you are already setup to access the AKS with kubectl via the command "az aks get-credentials". You also have access to the ACR via "az acr login" already, just make sure to use the correct azure subscription context.
